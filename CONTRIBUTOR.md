After you have forked and cloned the repository. You will each be assigned issues to complete. And to do so, you need to make 
a new branch. to create a branch :

```

After adding the new feature you have to first 


```console
$ git add .
```


```console
$ git commit -m "<message of commit>"
```


```console
$ git push origin <branch-name your working on>
```
